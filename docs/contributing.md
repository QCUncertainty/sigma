# Contributor Guidelines

## Asking Questions

Questions come up. We strive to have helpful documentation, but it's unlikely
to have all the answers. If you have a question, please search the
documentation and the GitHub issues for answers. If you cannot find the
answer then feel free to open a GitHub issue with the question.

## Ways to Contribute

There's three main ways to contribute:

1. Reporting Bugs

   Sigma uses GitHub's issue feature for bug tracking. If you think you have
   found a bug, please first search the issues to see if it has already been
   reported. If not, feel free to open a new issue using the "Bug report"
   template.

2. Suggesting Features

   We're happy to consider implementing new features. Just be aware it
   may take a while to implement the feature. Like bugs, we use GitHub's
   issue feature for tracking feature requests. Please do a quick search to
   make sure someone else hasn't already suggested the feature. If there is an
   open issue, feel free to add a comment in that issue. This will help us to
   track the need for a feature. If the feature is indeed new, then please open
   a new issue.

3. Contributing Code

   If you want to contribute code to a Sigma project go ahead and open a pull
   request (PR). We recommend you first create a draft PR explaining what you
   are going to do. This gives us a chance to provide feedback and help
   throughout the process. We welcome contributions to any part of the
   project, not just source code.


## Code of Conduct

All interactions with Sigma are governed by our
[Code of Conduct](./code_of_conduct.md).
