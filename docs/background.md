# Background

Given variables \f$ a = \bar{a} \pm \sigma_{a} \f$ and 
\f$ b = \bar{b} \pm \sigma_{b} \f$, where \f$\bar{x}\f$ is the median value
of a variable and \f$\sigma_{x}\f$ is the standard deviation of that variable,
the error of a value \f$c\f$ derived from operations on \f$a\f$ and \f$b\f$ 
can be determined as

\f{equation}{
  \sigma_{c} = \sqrt{...}
\f}
